    "# Second Harmonic Generation (SHG)\n",
    "Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) is a fascinating nonlinear optical process where two photons of the same frequency interact within a nonlinear material to create a new photon with twice the energy, and therefore, twice the frequency and half the wavelength of the original photons. This process is also known as frequency doubling.\n",
