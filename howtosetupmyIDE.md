# Steps to create a working environment:
1. Create a new codespace from your GitHub repository.
2. Press ">" to activate the command and type "Add Dev Container Configuration File".
3. Select it and click "Create new configuration"
4. Click "Show all Definitions".
5. Type "Python3" and select its version (I have selected the latest version 3.12).
6. Go to Extensions at the left and add necessary extensions such as Jupyter, pylint, pytest, etc. as per your requirements.
7. Add this extension to the devcontainer.json file by clicking the settings symbol.
8. Commit these changes.
9. Then rebuild the codespace system. Hence done! Your required environment is ready.
